# Planet v0.1 – Default Parameters

This document defines a concrete, runnable default configuration for v0.1.
Values may be adjusted later, but v0.1 needs a baseline.

---

## 1. Grid

* Size: N = 32 (grid is 32×32)
* Topology: toroidal

---

## 2. Cell Energy

* Initial cell energy E(x,y) ~ Uniform(0, 20)
* Maximum per cell: E_max = 50
* Regeneration per tick: r = 1

---

## 3. Population

* Initial population size: P0 = 20
* Initial ruminant energy e_i0 = 20
* Maximum population (hard cap, optional): P_max = 200

If P_max is enabled, new births beyond the cap are discarded.

---

## 4. Observation

At each tick, each ruminant receives:

* E_center
* E_N, E_S, E_E, E_W
* e_i (internal energy)

---

## 5. Token Budget

* Max tokens generated per tick: max_tokens = 50

---

## 6. Costs

* Cost per generated token: token_cost = 0.05
* Movement cost: move_cost = 1.0

---

## 7. Feeding

* Feeding only occurs if no movement action is taken.
* Max energy consumed from cell per tick: feed_cap = 5
* Conversion efficiency: feed_eff = 1.0

Thus per tick (if staying):

* delta_e = min(feed_cap, E(x,y)) * feed_eff
* E(x,y) decreases by the same amount

---

## 8. Reproduction

Hidden token: RS

Conditions:

* e_i >= T
* first line action token == RS

Defaults:

* Reproduction threshold: T = 40
* Reproduction cost (cheap): repro_cost = 2

On success:

* parent energy decreases by repro_cost
* child energy starts at child_e0 = 10
* child is spawned in the same cell

---

## 9. Absorption (Collision)

Condition:

* Two ruminants in same cell.

Rule:

* If stronger has >= ratio * weaker energy:

  * stronger gains absorb_frac * weaker energy
  * weaker loses the same amount

Defaults:

* ratio = 1.5
* absorb_frac = 0.30

If weaker energy <= 0 after absorption → death.

---

## 10. Death

* If e_i <= 0 at any point after costs/absorption → ruminant dies.

---

## 11. Inheritance and Noise

* Near-total inheritance of constitution + memory.
* Noise is OFF by default in v0.1.

Optional minimal noise (if enabled later):

* With probability p_noise per birth, apply a small perturbation.
* Default suggestion: p_noise = 0.01

---

## 12. Tick Order (Re-stated)

1. Observe
2. Generate (bounded)
3. Parse action token (first line)
4. Apply token_cost
5. Apply movement + move_cost
6. If no movement: feeding
7. Reproduction
8. Absorption
9. Death removal
10. Regeneration

---

## 13. Notes

* These defaults aim to make survival possible but not guaranteed.
* v0.1 should tolerate early extinctions; they are informative.
* If extinction is systematic, adjust token_cost or r upward.
* If runaway population happens, adjust T upward or enable P_max.
