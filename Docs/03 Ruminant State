# Ruminant State – v0.1 Specification

## 1. Overview

A ruminant is defined not only by its position and energy, but by its heritable internal state.

In v0.1, inheritance is near-total.
The child receives almost all structural advantages discovered by the parent.

---

## 2. State Components

Each ruminant contains:

### 2.1 Position (Non-heritable)

* (x, y) coordinates on the grid.

### 2.2 Internal Energy (Non-heritable)

* Current internal energy e_i.
* Child starts with predefined minimal energy.

### 2.3 Constitution (Heritable)

A textual internal constitution that may include:

* Behavioral heuristics
* Discovered action tokens
* Observed correlations
* Internal rules
* Experimental strategies

This is stored as structured text.

---

## 3. Memory Model

The ruminant maintains a bounded memory buffer.

Memory may include:

* Recent observations
* Action-effect correlations
* Local experiments

The entire memory buffer is inherited by the child.

Memory size is capped to avoid unbounded growth.

---

## 4. Inheritance Model

On reproduction:

* The child receives an almost exact copy of:

  * Constitution
  * Memory

* Optional minimal stochastic perturbation may be introduced.

The perturbation must be small enough to:

* Allow variation
* Avoid structural collapse

---

## 5. Noise Policy (v0.1)

Noise should be:

* Low probability
* Localized
* Non-destructive

Examples:

* Small textual mutation
* Random token insertion
* Slight rule modification

Noise must not invalidate discovered working tokens systematically.

---

## 6. Action Discovery

If a parent discovers that a token triggers movement or reproduction:

* That token is stored in the constitution.
* Children inherit that knowledge.

This allows rapid lineage expansion once a discovery is made.

---

## 7. Identity

There is no global identity tracking in v0.1.
Lineage is tracked externally via logs.

---

## 8. Design Goal

The goal of this inheritance system is to:

* Enable accumulation of structural advantage
* Allow discovery to propagate
* Maintain evolutionary pressure

Without near-total inheritance, discoveries would be lost each generation.

v0.1 deliberately favors rapid structural fixation once useful patterns are found.
