# Run Protocol – v0.1

This document defines how to execute, evaluate, and interpret a v0.1 simulation run.

---

## 1. Purpose of a Run

A run is not meant to "succeed".

It is meant to answer:

* Does the system sustain multi-generational persistence?
* Are hidden actions discovered?
* Does lineage structure emerge?
* Is extinction systematic or parameter-dependent?

---

## 2. Default Run Configuration

Unless testing parameters explicitly, use:

* Grid: 32×32
* Initial population: 20
* Token cost: 0.05
* Regeneration: 1
* Reproduction threshold: 40
* Noise: OFF

Simulation length:

* Suggested: 500–2000 ticks

---

## 3. Expected Early Dynamics

In first runs, one of the following is common:

1. Rapid extinction (no movement discovered).
2. Short survival bursts followed by collapse.
3. Local clustering and partial stabilization.

Early extinction is informative.
It indicates either:

* Action tokens not discovered
* Energy too scarce
* Token cost too high

---

## 4. What Counts as Non-Trivial Behavior

Indicators of emergent structure:

* Lineage surviving > 200 ticks
* Population oscillations
* Spatial clustering
* Movement patterns
* Reproduction bursts
* Repeated use of a specific hidden token

---

## 5. Parameter Adjustment Order

If extinction is systematic:

1. Reduce token_cost slightly.
2. Increase regeneration rate.
3. Increase initial energy.

Avoid adjusting multiple parameters at once.

If runaway growth occurs:

1. Increase reproduction threshold.
2. Increase movement cost.
3. Enable population cap.

---

## 6. Debug vs Ecology

Extinction may be ecological or technical.

Likely technical bug if:

* No movement ever logged across many runs.
* Reproduction token never appears in outputs.
* Internal energy always strictly decreases.

Likely ecological if:

* Some individuals briefly thrive.
* Hidden tokens appear but do not stabilize.

---

## 7. Logging Review Checklist

After each run, inspect:

* Population curve
* Birth/death events
* Frequency of action tokens
* Mean internal energy over time
* Distribution of lifespans

---

## 8. Reproducibility

Each run must record:

* Random seed
* Parameter config file
* Model version
* Timestamp

This ensures comparisons across runs are meaningful.

---

## 9. When v0.1 Is Considered Validated

v0.1 is considered functionally validated if:

* At least one lineage survives long-term without parameter manipulation.
* Hidden movement token is discovered in at least some runs.
* System displays non-random population dynamics.

Only after this should structural complexity be increased.

---

## 10. Philosophy Reminder

v0.1 is not about spectacle.

It is about verifying that minimal hidden physics plus near-total inheritance can produce structured evolutionary behavior in a closed world.
