# Planet v0.1 – Technical Specification

## 1. Space

* 2D toroidal grid.
* Default size: 32×32.
* Each cell (x,y) stores an energy value E(x,y).

Toroidal topology:

* Moving beyond any boundary wraps around to the opposite side.

---

## 2. Energy Model

Each cell has:

* Current energy E(x,y).
* Maximum capacity E_max.
* Regeneration rate r per tick.

Per tick:
E(x,y) = min(E_max, E(x,y) + r)

---

## 3. Ruminant Structure

Each ruminant has:

* Position (x,y)
* Internal energy e_i
* Heritable state (textual constitution + memory)

Initial population: ~20.

---

## 4. Observation Model

At each tick the ruminant receives:

* Energy in current cell.
* Energy in North, South, East, West cells.
* Its internal energy e_i.

It does NOT receive:

* Coordinates
* Global map
* Population size
* Explicit rules

---

## 5. Action System (Hidden Physics)

The engine parses the first line of the model output.

Valid hidden tokens:

Movement:

* NA → move north
* SA → move south
* EA → move east
* WA → move west

Reproduction:

* RS → attempt reproduction

Any other output → no movement action.

These tokens are not documented to the ruminants.

---

## 6. Feeding

If a ruminant remains in a cell during a tick:

* It consumes up to c units of energy from E(x,y).
* Its internal energy increases accordingly.
* Cell energy decreases.

---

## 7. Movement Cost

If movement occurs:

* Internal energy decreases by m_cost.

---

## 8. Reproduction

If:

* Internal energy e_i ≥ threshold T
* Output token == RS

Then:

* A new ruminant is created in the same cell.
* Child inherits near-total state of parent.
* Optional minimal noise can be added.
* Reproduction cost is small.

---

## 9. Collision / Absorption

If two ruminants occupy the same cell:

* If one has ≥ 1.5× energy of the other:

  * Stronger absorbs fraction a of weaker.
  * Weaker may die if energy ≤ 0.

---

## 10. Tick Order

For each tick:

1. All ruminants observe.
2. All generate output (bounded tokens).
3. Parse actions.
4. Apply movement.
5. Apply feeding.
6. Apply reproduction.
7. Apply absorption.
8. Remove dead ruminants.
9. Regenerate cell energy.

---

## 11. Logging (Minimal)

Per tick record:

* Population size
* Births
* Deaths
* Movements
* Absorptions
* Mean internal energy

---

## 12. Objective of v0.1

Determine whether hidden but inferable physical rules combined with near-total inheritance produce non-trivial multi-generational dynamics in a closed world.
