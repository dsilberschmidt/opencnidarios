# Project Timeline

This document consolidates the chronological evolution of the Cnidarios project.

---

## July 12–14, 2025

Initial articulation of **Cnidarios 0.1**.

Characteristics:

* Conceptual formulation of "ruminants".
* Closed ecological framing.
* Emphasis on blind evolutionary pressure.
* Speculative extensions (laboratory extraction, monolith interface, multi-planet scenarios).
* Institutional-oriented proposal context.

No concrete numeric specification existed at this stage.

---

## Post July 2025 – Conceptual Consolidation

Refinement of:

* Hidden physics model.
* Near-total inheritance principle.
* Minimal ecological substrate.

Separation begins between:

* Historical conceptual layer (Cnidarios 0.1)
* Runnable open implementation track

---

## OpenCnidarios – Open Implementation Phase

Transition toward:

* Fully specified closed-world simulation.
* Minimal viable planetary physics (v0.1).
* Explicit numeric parameters.
* Engine architecture definition.
* Run protocol and reproducibility.

This phase marks the shift from speculative framing to implementable system.

---

## v0.1 Milestone

Definition of:

* 32×32 toroidal planet
* Hidden two-letter action tokens
* Cheap reproduction under threshold conditions
* Absorption rule
* Near-total inheritance
* Minimal logging and run protocol

v0.1 represents the first fully specified and runnable configuration.

## Archival Policy

All historical documents remain preserved under `/history/`.

OpenCnidarios documentation reflects the active implementation track.

No retroactive rewriting of original conceptual framing is permitted.
Addenda must be appended explicitly if clarification is needed.
