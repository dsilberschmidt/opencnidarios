# Cnidarios 0.1 – July 2025 (Original Framing)

## Context

Cnidarios 0.1 was articulated between July 12–14, 2025 as a conceptual proposal.

It preceded the open-source implementation track and was framed within an institutional environment.

This document preserves that original conceptual orientation.

## Core Idea (Original Formulation)

* Population of LLM-based entities (“ruminants”).
* Closed ecological environment.
* Energy-limited existence.
* Discovery of hidden structural affordances.
* Near-total inheritance.
* Possibility of emergent "wows" (unexpected structural behaviors).

At this stage, the framing included:

* Exploratory ambition toward generality.
* Speculation about laboratory extraction and external interaction.
* Conceptual alignment discussions with prior research on ruminant-like systems.

The implementation mechanics were not yet formalized.

## Conceptual Emphasis (Historical)

Cnidarios 0.1 emphasized:

* Blind evolutionary dynamics.
* Emergence without explicit reward signals.
* The possibility that structured cognition might arise from minimal physics.

It was more philosophical and exploratory than technical.

## Differences from OpenCnidarios v0.1

OpenCnidarios v0.1:

* Is fully specified.
* Is minimal and runnable.
* Avoids speculative expansion.

Cnidarios 0.1:

* Was broader in scope.
* Included ideas later postponed (human interaction, monolith, laboratory extraction).
* Did not yet define concrete numeric parameters.

## Archival Integrity

This folder preserves the historical conceptual layer.

It should not be retroactively rewritten to match the later technical formalization.

Addenda may be appended, but original framing should remain intact.
