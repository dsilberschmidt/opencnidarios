# Historical Archive

This directory preserves the conceptual and chronological origin of the Cnidarios project.

The purpose of this archive is:

* Document authorship and timeline.
* Separate exploratory phases from the executable open version.
* Preserve original framing without rewriting it retroactively.

## 2025-07 – Cnidarios 0.1 (Institutional Proposal Phase)

This phase corresponds to the initial conceptual articulation of the project between July 12–14, 2025.

Characteristics of that phase:

* Framed as a proposal directed toward a specific institutional context.
* Contained early formulations of "ruminants".
* Included exploratory ambition beyond what is now v0.1.
* Preceded the open-source framing.

Files inside that folder should remain historically faithful, even if technically incomplete.

## Separation Principle

OpenCnidarios (current repository) is the reproducible, open implementation track.

Cnidarios 0.1 is preserved here as historical origin, not as active specification.

No historical file should be silently rewritten.
If clarification is needed, add an addendum instead of editing the original.

## Archival Policy

* Preserve timestamps when possible.
* Avoid retroactive conceptual cleaning.
* Clearly mark speculative documents as such.

This archive exists to maintain intellectual continuity and traceability.
